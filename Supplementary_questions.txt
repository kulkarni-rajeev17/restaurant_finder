1)Please give a rough estimate of how long you spent on the Python Coding Challenge?
Ans)I spent nearly a day doing this challenge. I spent most of my time parsing the given data and making it more useful.

2)2. If you had more time available, what features would you like to add to your script to make it more useful?
Ans)If I had more time I would have added a feature where the user could favriote a restuarant and can have easier access to its data much quicker.

3)Did you experience any issues/difficulties whilst writing your code? 
Did you encounter any problems with using the API? If so, please provide details and describe how you resolved/overcame these obstacles?
Ans)One of the few dificulties I encountered while writing code was parsing the data and formatting the data to put it in a clear and understandble manner.
I went through the official documentation which gave me a much clearer perspective.

The only dificulty I faced while using the API was giving cuisine as a parameter. 
Even if I gave cuisine as a parameter the API showed results the same as not entering a cuisine and only entering a postcode.
I resolved this issues by building a cusine selector in my code and returning the result of that.

4)Do you have any suggestions as to how the Just Eat API could be improved?
Ans)Some of the suggestions on how API can be improved is:
1) Even if we give an invalid postcode the api returns results with 0 resturants. Maybe we can throw an error if the user has entered a invalid Postcode.
2)The cuisine parameter should give the user the results with that particulat cuisine instead of all the cuisine's in the area.


I have had a ton of fun building this script.
